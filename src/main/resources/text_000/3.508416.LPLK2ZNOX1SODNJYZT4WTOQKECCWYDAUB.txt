I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

heard last night that forest oil is marketing through aec again in
december.  also heard they have been instructed not to sell to enron.  aec
has also received directives not to sell to enron.  are you hearing that a
lot?

sorry to open with negative news.  hope you're doing well today.  i'm a bit
tired.  was up late for the avs game last night then got up early for my
training at the gym this morning.  may require high amounts of caffeine
today.

might do a quick drink with a friend tonight.  are you working out after
work?  if you have no plans maybe you could meet us for a drink.  it will
be an early night for me.

have a great day

kt
