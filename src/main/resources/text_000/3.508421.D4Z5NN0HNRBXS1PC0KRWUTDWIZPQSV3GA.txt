Subject: Action Alert on Energy Legislation

Energy legislation that is helpful to our industry still has a chance of becoming law in this session of congress.  IPAMS needs your participation in contacting members of congress to voice your support for H.R. 4.  Read Below for further details.
Although energy legislation appeared dead in this session of congress, Congressman Nethercutt (R-WA) is seeking support for passing H.R. 4 as a Department of Defense appropriations measure.  According to the Congressman, by placing H.R. 4 in an appropriations measure, it will force bicameral conference on the issue.   However, the Congressman needs our support in order to succeed.
I am trying to get an electronic version of the communication which was faxed to IPAMS, in order to post it on our website.  Regardless we need fast action by email to support this measure.  In response I have drafted a simple letter for IPAMS members to email to all congressman on the appropriations committee.  The text of that letter and the email addresses of the House Appropriations Committee members  Send one on behalf of your company, all employees who are willing to participate, your parents, children, grandparents, etc.  But let’s get the word out.  And please pass this along to anyone who may be interested in supporting energy legislation.  Read below for instructions on getting the word out 
For those of you who are not familiar with H.R. 4 I have attached a copy.  Please read.  It is not 100% perfect but it addresses many issues facing IPAMS members.  
If you have any questions or want further information, please call me at (303) 623-0987.  
Simple Two Step Process to Get the Word Out
Step #1: Cut or Copy and Paste the text below into the body of the email. Then put your name under the signature line.
 
Dear House Appropriations Committee Member:
As a member of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), the purpose of this letter is to express support for Congressman Nethercutt’s efforts to pass H.R. 4 through the house appropriations committee.  H.R. 4 garnered bipartisan support in the House and provides long overdue legislation implementing a national energy strategy.  National energy legislation is a vital component to national security.   
IPAMS represents independent oil and gas producers in a thirteen state region in the western United States.  IPAMS is committed to assisting its members to continue producing America’s natural resources in an environmentally conscious manner.  For more information please review our website at www.ipams.org or contact IPAMS at (303) 623-0987.
Very Truly Yours

Step #2:       Cut (or Copy) and Paste the below email addresses for the members of the House Appropriations Committee into the Blind Carbon Copy (bcc) line of your email program (this makes the email seem like it goes just to that Congressman).  Also, please put my email address (abremner@ipams.org) in the Carbon Copy (cc) line so I can monitor the response.
