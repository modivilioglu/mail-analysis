Good morning,

For those of you who don't know me I have taken Anne Bike's place as manager of the West risk desk.  I am in the process of loading the Natural Gas Prices reports your currently getting by e-mail onto a website.  Once this is ready you will be able to access this website daily to view these reports.

In order to grant you access I will need to get your NT login ID and your e-mail address.


Can you please reply with this information and any questions or concerns you may have.

Thanks

Kam
