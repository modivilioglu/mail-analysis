As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new." 


Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.
