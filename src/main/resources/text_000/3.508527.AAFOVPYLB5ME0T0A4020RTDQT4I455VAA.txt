I sent out a link to PGS' winter / spring seminar schedule
yesterday, but our website server was down during the
middle of the day.  The enclosed link is in case you didn't
receive it the first time, or it didn't work. The original 
message is shown below.

Just a reminder before the end-of-year rush.
  
 If you are planning to attend one of PGS' Houston seminars
this February, it may make sense to register before the 
 end of the year, depending on your schedule and specific 
 budget situation. 
   
Available seminars include:             
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options

 Save money by bringing a group of 4 or more. With a group
rate, your cost for our $1,295 seminars is reduced to $895 per
attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from our regular prices. The 
 group price for the $695 programs is $495.
  
 Please forward this information to anyone who might benefit from
a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk management,
gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or electric power trading. 
 
 Thank you.
