Dear Mark Whitt,

Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.

Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
is a factor), because it's based on the very low "bulk" rates Sierra Trading
Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.

If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
do so in the "Shipping" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
the "Comments" section. 

Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.

Sincerely,

Vici
Customer Service
Sierra Trading Post
