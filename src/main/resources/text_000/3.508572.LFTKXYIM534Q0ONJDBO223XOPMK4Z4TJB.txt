Mark,

Thanks very much for the information.  I left a message Friday for Clifford.  


I arrive into Denver around 8:30 a.m.  I have lunch planned with Bierbach at 
11:30 and a meeting with a headhunter at 1:30 p.m.  If I can't hook up with 
Clifford I will come by in the afternoon.  I look forward to seeing you and 
your family.  Talk to you soon.

Kind regards,

-Larry-
