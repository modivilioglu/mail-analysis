Just wanted to follow-up with the status on the gas proposal that you
submitted.   I have been a little bit side-tracked with a financing project,
but still plan to meet with the management group in the next couple of weeks
to review the proposals.   Please let me know if you have any updates or
changes to your proposal that you submitted.  Thanks again for your
patience.
