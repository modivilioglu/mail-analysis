Invoices should be processed as normal.  I have given the invoice to CSS. (our outsource service provider for contract labor) This invoice should be processed through CSS.

Note: Enron is not allowed to issue checks for pre-petition invoices.

Thanks,
Ron

Just wanted to follow up on the Corestaff Invoice I faxed over to you on the 17th.  What is the procedure now for such payments?
