Sue, Just wanted to let you know that we filed comments in support of Xcel's ability to manage price risk and be incentivized to do so.  If you have questions about our comments, give me a call.

303-575-6473

Thanks,
Mark

The attached comments were filed today with the Colorado PUC.

A hearing is scheduled for November 1, 2001 in which Enron's and other parties' comments will be presented to the Commissioners by the Commission's Staff.
