Subject:
Huber – El Paso San Juan Transaction
Date:
October 15, 2001


The purpose of this memo is to clarify the internal parameters associated with the booking and management of the J M Huber San Juan purchase transaction.  

The structure of the deal is as follows:


ENA permanently releases 30,000 Mmbtu per day of  PG&E recallable, El Paso capacity to Huber for a term of November 1, 2001 through May 31, 2006.
ENA will then take assignment of that capacity annually in order to purchase Huber’s San Juan gas under a netback arrangement where Huber is responsible for all costs associated with this capacity.  Additionally ENA will be responsible for scheduling this gas on both the Williams Field Services gathering system and El Paso.  The Denver Producer Services Desk will schedule the gathering system and Houston Logistics will schedule the El Paso capacity.  Coordination between these two groups will be critical.
The purchase contract will be broken up into the following three tiers:
