Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline. 

Thanks,  Penny

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,
