Subject: Cheyenne gas supply proposal

Please find the attached draft version of our proposed gas supply structure.  We have focused on minimizing your fixed charges while still giving you the right to call on up to 30,000 mmbtu/d of Firm Cheyenne supplies.  In addition, Enron will manage your transportation and imbalances associated with your PSCO transportation contracts.  Obviously we will need to see those contracts prior to finalizing this transaction in order to assure we can meet those obligations.  In addition, I am sure we will need to "tweak" this proposal to meet you physical requirements (volumes, terms etc.)  Please give me a call once you have had a chance to review the attached.
