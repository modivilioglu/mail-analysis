I am so sorry about Jack.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

I know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.

Love

Mark Whitt
