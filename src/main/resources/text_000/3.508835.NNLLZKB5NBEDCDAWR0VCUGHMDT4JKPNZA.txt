Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.
