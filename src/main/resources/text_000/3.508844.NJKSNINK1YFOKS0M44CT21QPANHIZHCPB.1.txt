PNW Gas Issues
Supply - no local production
Demand – from strong growth to reduction
Storage – limited storage capacity
Pipelines - pipes fully subscribed
California – proximity creates uncertainty
Gas-fired generation – is the dream over
Weather – forecasts move markets
Prices – aforementioned issues drive volatility

Canadian Rig Counts are Up
Record Levels of Canadian Activity
Most recent data indicates 328 active rigs at the end of August
This is off 43% from the year-to-date high of 539 rigs in January 2001
Similar constraints as those found in the U.S. market

Canadian Field Receipts

A mosquito-ridden bog in remote northeastern British Columbia has become one of Canada's richest finds of the past two decades

Canadian Natural said test results from its recent Ladyfern well showed it had the capability of producing 100 million cubic feet of gas a day, rivaling some finds in the deep water Gulf of Mexico

Ladyfern is expected to deliver between 100 million and 150 million cubic feet per day during the last half of 2001.



Ladyfern May Represent a Significant 
Supply Addition

Canadian Imports are Strong 
and Growing
Note: The bulk of these imports are
going to the Midwest and Northeast.
Increases come largely from new 
production not cannibalization of 
existing production.

Rockies Rig Counts are Up Too

Drilling is continuing at the highest pace in over a decade despite the infrastructure constraints that have appeared over the last year.

Note: Powder River Basin CBM rigs are excluded from the Baker-Hughes Wyoming rig count due the shallow nature of the CBM wells

Coal Bed Methane Play will Increase Rockies Production
Key Features
 - On pace to drill 4,500 wells per year, average of 11 wells per day
 - Average production per well = 125 Mcf/d
 - No production decline curve has been established, but industry is working on one
 - CBM play has an estimated life span of 35 years, with each individual well lasting between
   5-10 years
 - Peak daily production estimated to be 2 Bcf/d

     Possible Delays to Future Development 
 - Water discharge permits
 - BLM EIS, These studies are on going and continually analyze the cumulative effect on the 
   environment

The US Storage Picture
The Rapid Pace Continues
Strong storage levels reflective of weak fundamentals
Unprecedented level of injections have been a critical factor in market declines
As of September 2, the year-over-year storage surplus was 386 Bcf
8 weeks left in injection season
High probability of reaching 11/5/98 storage high of 3,094 Bcf

PNW Hydro Power – Why Didn’t the Lights Go Out
The hydro shortage is real: Dams are at 55% of capacity second worst year on record
Storage for next year is way behind
Load will bottoms out in September and builds through the winter
Load shedding averted the widely forecast crisis
1800 MW of aluminum smelting shut off
Seattle and Tacoma raised rate 45% before summer
No meaningful forecasts until December
