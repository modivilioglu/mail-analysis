We usually see mostly regional basis deals out of our office.  Especially with the bigger guys.  We do some Nymex trades for our smaller producers.  It seems the big guys use their banks for most of their  basis.  Thanks for the info.

Decision and physical/financial hedging are all done in the US and with "US types".
They might allow the Cdns to do the odd Aeco basis deal.

Hey guys, new subject.
Got a call today from a cogen in the PNW lookin for AECO, Sumas and Rockies gas.  They're issuing an RFP.  I'll forward it on as soon as I get it and we'll work it together.

Are you saying that the U.S. Producers are hedging their Canadian Production with U.S. counterparties as opposed to Canadian counterparties?  Or are the decisions being made in the U.S. and executed in Canada?

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.
