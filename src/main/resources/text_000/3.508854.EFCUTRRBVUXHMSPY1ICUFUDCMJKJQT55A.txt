Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity


Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 6th segment to gate valve 5 providing a
total firm capacity of 519 Mdth/day was approved by FERC yesterday and is
available for transport.  The contract effective date for this additional
capacity will be on Monday, November 5.  We plan on filing the request for
the final segment of additional contacted capacity to gate valve 4 today or
Monday.

Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of
additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this
last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your
transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service
(anticipated late this month).  For the month of October, the capacity
contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater
utilization for November.  While a few of you have mentioned possibly having
production in excess of your contract, it appears that the remaining
shippers will have underutilized capacity and no additional capacity will be
necessary until the Loop goes in service.    

Following the last segment approval notice, I will continue to update you on
the progress and timing for the entire Loop in-service for your information
and planning. 

Please call me if you have any questions.
