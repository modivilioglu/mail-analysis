Thermo Ft. Lupton Co-generation Plant

November 5, 2001

Lee Robinson of Thermo Partners has expressed interest in obtaining quotes from Enron for the following scenarios:  1) a long-term energy purchase of Thermo’s Ft. Lupton plant’s power,  2) a long-term tolling arrangement for the facility, and 3) an outright purchase of the Ft. Lupton facility.

The Ft. Lupton facility is currently owned 50% by Thermo Partners and 50% by AEP.  At this point, AEP is not a part of these discussions.  Lee Robinson would like to develop the potential deal with Enron further before beginning any buy-out discussions with AEP.  The Ft. Lupton facility is currently a QF under a long-term PPA with PSCo; however, our proposals should be based on the assumption that Thermo will negotiate a termination to the PPA, effective early 2002, and will operate as a merchant facility going forward.  Lee has indicated he would like to know if there is real potential for a deal in the next couple of weeks so that he can initiate the necessary negotiations with the other parties.

For discussion purposes, we can assume that our proposal should have a start date of July 1, 2002 and the energy purchase and tolling proposals should extend through 2009.

The following is a summary of the known characteristics of the Ft. Lupton facility and its associated contracts:

Plant Capacity: 272 MW

Approx. Heat Rate: 8,900

Entry Point to Power Grid: Ft. Lupton

Estimated Variable Cost (used for budgeting): $.003 / KWh

Long-term Fuel Contracts: approximately 24,000 MMBtu/d at an average burner tip price of $2.50

Current Load Factor under QF PPA: 65-68%, with a monthly fuel requirement of roughly 1,000,000 MMBtu (~33,000 MMBtu/d)

Estimated Load Factor as a merchant plant (per Lee Robinson): 40-45%, implying an monthly fuel requirement of roughly 700,000 MMBtu (~23,000 MMBtu/d)
