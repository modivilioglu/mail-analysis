I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you see any other changes that are necessary.

Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize our other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?
