Thanks for the update, we will coordinate with Jason while you are out.  As you evaluate the latest proposal, I understand that Huber may have credit concerns with Enron given all the rumors that are circulating.  You know we are confident we will straighten things out soon. However, please understand that we are willing to do what is necessary to make Huber comfortable (Pre-pay, Letter of credit etc).  If you have any questions just give me a call.

I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those
should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you
see
any other changes that are necessary.

Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize
our
other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by
December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?
