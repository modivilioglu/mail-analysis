Have you started thinking about falling back on that pro wrestling career

Have you made Lauren and Brock get jobs to help out a little?
Lauren's probably big enough to push a lawnmower or farm-out to the textile

Also, before the Feds bust down your office door, I would try to delete as
much porn off your hard drive as possible - it just doesn't look right.
