We would love to have you and Kim.  Might even be some snow by then.  Just let me know if you can make it so they can get a good head count.

FYI

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal.
