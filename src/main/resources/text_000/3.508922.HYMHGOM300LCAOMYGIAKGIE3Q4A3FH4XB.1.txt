The Management Committee and Board of Directors of Enron Corporation Want to Set the Record Strait
The Management Committee and Board of Directors is working hard to see us all through the current crisis.
We ask for every employee’s support as we call on each Board member’s vast industry experience to guide us through this difficult time.
Thank you.
Me give you 1 cookie.  We put in off-balance sheet special purpose vehicle where we mark cookie’s value at 2 cookies.  Then me issue debt backed by those two cookies for amount equal to 3 cookies with proceeds going towards purchase of 4 cookies. 
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 Cookies!!
