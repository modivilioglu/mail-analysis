The open season for CIG's Parachute Creek lateral will end next Friday, Nov. 30.  It is for delivery to either NWPL at Sand Springs, Queastar at meter station 101 in Utah, or TransColorado at Dark Canyon.  

Do you need more info on this and/or do you think we will want to participate?  Let me know.

Phil
