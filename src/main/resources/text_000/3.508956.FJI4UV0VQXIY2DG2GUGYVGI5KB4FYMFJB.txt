Please verify the Houston fax number.  Isn't "303" a Denver prefix??  Thanks.

Mark,

Please disregard the comments on the fax cover sheet just sent to you. You should have received with the cover sheet the Notice letter from Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC regarding the Master Services Agreement. If you did not receive that letter, please notify me as soon as possible. 

Janet Place
