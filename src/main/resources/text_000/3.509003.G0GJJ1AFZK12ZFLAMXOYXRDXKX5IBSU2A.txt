Everything is ok, just boring.  Went to the Diamond cabaret for lunch.  We are heading to Texas for Xmas but I doubt we will get to Houston.  Interviewing alot but also waiting on the sale.  We have been promised it will be a good deal.  Oh well, not much else to do.

Take care and thanks for the note.

Been thinking about you, but figured you were busy.  Asked the Jernigan's
how you were doing and if your group was included in the filing.  They said
it was, you were trying to sell your group and that you didn't seem worried
at all, which is good.  Good Luck with that as I know it will be tough.  On
the bright side, if you sell it, you are a friggin hero for pulling off a
deal in a tough environment.  If you don't and go get another job, well
that's what everyone expects anyway.  Again, good luck, tell Lucci hey and
have a Merry Christmas.
