sometimes things really suck out loud, don't they?  I still plan on coming 
into the office tomorrow.  Like I said, maybe we just need to ride it out 
and things will be fine...and we'll all live happily ever after!  (keeping 
my finger and legs crossed)  Still feel like going out on Friday?  Maybe we 
should do it downtown somewhere.  Comedy works first then dancing?  Keep 
your chin up you handsome devil!
