Texas Lutheran University has hired an independent market research firm, 
Carnegie Communications, to conduct a study of alumni perceptions and needs. 
Your feedback on the short survey will be invaluable as the College continues 
its strategic planning process. The link below will take you directly to 
the online survey. Once there, point and click your way through the questions, 
and click on "submit" when done. All who respond will be entered in a drawing 
to win a gift pack valued at $250 from the TLU bookstore. 

Thank you!
