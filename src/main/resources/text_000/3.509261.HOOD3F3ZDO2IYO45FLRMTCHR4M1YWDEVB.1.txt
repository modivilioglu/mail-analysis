 The capacity will be assigned on a permanent basis at 100% of full tolls and BP shall assume all obligations related to this capacity upon the approval and execution of the related transportation assignment documents as required by EPNG.

Service Type:   Block II subject to recall rights for deliveries outside California

Assignee:   BP Amoco

Assignor:   Enron North America

Renewal Rights: ENA shall permanently assign capacity including all applicable renewal rights as available by EPNG. 
 
Conditions Precedent: (a) EPNG shall confirm that BP satisfies the necessary creditworthiness requirements for the purposes of permitting the transfer of the Assigned Capacity to BP.
 
 (b) BP shall provide all necessary documentation and credit covenants as required by EPNG. 

 (c) ENA shall be released unconditionally from any obligations once the permanent assignment documentation has been facilitated.

Assignment Procedure: BP agrees to satisfy any requirements of El Paso and execute any and all documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the permanent release of the Capacity. 

Consideration: Consideration may take one of the following forms:


Enron assigns the capacity and makes a one-time, up-front payment to offset the negative mark-to-market value of the space.


Enron assigns the capacity and makes a series of annual payments.  Under this structure Enron would pay out a series of annual payments equal to the one-time payment in 1 above on a present value basis.


Enron assigns the capacity and makes a balloon payment in the final year.  BP would be allowed to “call” these funds forward on a present value basis if it chooses to do so.


Enron assigns the capacity and “remarks” one or more existing trades that Enron has with the assignee as a method of payment.  


Enron assigns the capacity and bundles it with an “in the money” asset.  The assignee would receive another asset or assets that offset the negative value of the El Paso space.  


Enron assigns the capacity with a discounted demand charge.  Enron would discount the demand charge to the assignee and compensate El Paso directly for the difference.  


Enron assigns the capacity and offsets the negative mark-to-market with an out-of-the-money swap or above-the-market gas purchase.  In this structure the parties would enter into a new swap or gas purchase with a term that matches the capacity assignment.  The price would be “above the market” in an amount equal to the amount that the capacity is “below the market.”
