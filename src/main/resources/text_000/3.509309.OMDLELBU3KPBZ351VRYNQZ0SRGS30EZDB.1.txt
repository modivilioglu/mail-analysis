Mr. Mark Whitt, Director
Enron North America Corp.

Denver, CO 80202
 
Dear Mark:

Enclosed please find my resume for your review and consideration with regard to available positions at Enron. As a result of the completion of the divestitures by TBI Field Services, Inc. of a majority of the interests acquired from Wildhorse and Rulison, I have been informed that my position here at Tom Brown, Inc. is being eliminated effective November 30, 2001.

Although I am most interested in continuing in the Business Development field, please note that I also have experience in the areas of Contract Administration, Land Management, Acquisitions and Divestitures including Due Diligence support, Financial Analysis, Shrink and Fuel Management, Land Administration, Right-of-way Administration, Regulatory Reporting and Accounting.

I am looking for a full-time position, with benefits, and my salary requirements are negotiable.

I would be available for employment in early November. Although my end date here at Tom Brown, Inc. is November 30th, if I should land a position before that date it would not affect any of my severance benefits from Tom Brown, Inc. Further, my supervisors tell me that I am leaving on good terms having participated in the successfully completed divestitures of the former Wildhorse and Rulison interests.

I enjoyed working with you on our previous dealings and I thank you for your time and consideration. If you should have any questions, or require any additional information, do not hesitate to contact me at any of the numbers or e-mail addresses shown below.

Respectfully,


Kent H. Harris
