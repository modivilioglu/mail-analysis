GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
BASE CONTRACT FOR SHORT-TERM
SALE AND PURCHASE OF NATURAL GAS
SECTION 1.  PURPOSE AND PROCEDURES
1.1. These General Terms and Conditions are intended to facilitate purchase and sale transactions of Gas on a Firm or Interruptible basis.  "Buyer" refers to the party receiving Gas and "Seller" refers to the party delivering Gas.

The parties have selected either the “Oral” version or the “Written” version of transaction procedures as indicated on the Base Contract.
Oral Transaction Procedure:
1.2 The parties will use the following Transaction Confirmation procedure.  Any Gas purchase and sale transaction may be effectuated in an EDI transmission or telephone conversation with the offer and acceptance constituting the agreement of the parties.  The parties shall be legally bound from the time they so agree to transaction terms and may each rely thereon.  Any such transaction shall be considered a “writing” and to have been “signed”.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the parties agree that Confirming Party shall, and the other party may, confirm a telephonic transaction by sending the other party a Transaction Confirmation by facsimile, EDI or mutually agreeable electronic means.  Confirming Party adopts its confirming letterhead, or the like, as its signature on any Transaction Confirmation as the identification and authentication of Confirming Party.  
Written Transaction Procedure:
1.2 The parties will use the following Transaction Confirmation procedure.  Should the parties come to an agreement regarding a Gas purchase and sale transaction for a particular Delivery Period, the Confirming Party shall, and the other party may, record that agreement on a Transaction Confirmation and communicate such Transaction Confirmation by facsimile, EDI or mutually agreeable electronic means, to the other party by the close of the Business Day following the date of agreement.  The parties acknowledge that their agreement will not be binding until the exchange of non-conflicting Transaction Confirmation or the passage of the Confirm Deadline without objection from the receiving party, as provided in Section 1.3.

1.3. If a sending party's Transaction Confirmation is materially different from the receiving party's understanding of the agreement referred to in Section 1.2., such receiving party shall notify the sending party via facsimile by the Confirm Deadline, unless such receiving party has previously sent a Transaction Confirmation to the sending party.  The failure of the receiving party to so notify the sending party in writing by the Confirm Deadline constitutes the receiving party's agreement to the terms of the transaction described in the sending party's Transaction Confirmation.  If there are any material differences between timely sent Transaction Confirmations governing the same transaction, then neither Transaction Confirmation shall be binding until or unless such differences are resolved including the use of any evidence that clearly resolves the differences in the Transaction Confirmations. The entire agreement between the parties shall be those provisions contained in both the Base Contract and any effective Transaction Confirmation.   In the event of a conflict among the terms of (i) a Transaction Confirmation, (ii) the Base Contract, and (iii) these General Terms and Conditions, the terms of the documents shall govern in the priority listed in this sentence.

Seller agrees to sell and deliver, and Buyer agrees to receive and purchase, the Contract Quantity for a particular transaction in accordance with the terms of the Contract.  Sales and purchases will be on a Firm or Interruptible basis, as specified in the Transaction Confirmation.

The parties have selected the “Cover Standard” version or the “Spot Price Standard” version as indicated on the Base Contract.

 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
SECTION  4. TRANSPORTATION, NOMINATIONS AND IMBALANCES
4.1. Seller shall have the sole responsibility for transporting the Gas to the Delivery Point(s) and for delivering such Gas at a pressure sufficient to effect such delivery but not to exceed the maximum operating pressure of the Receiving Transporter.  Buyer shall have the sole responsibility for transporting the Gas from the Delivery Point(s).
4.2. The parties shall coordinate their nomination activities, giving sufficient time to meet the deadlines of the affected Transporter(s).  Each party shall give the other party timely prior notice, sufficient to meet the requirements of all Transporter(s) involved in the transaction, of the quantities of Gas to be delivered and purchased each Day.  Should either party become aware that actual deliveries at the Delivery Point(s) are greater or lesser than the Scheduled Gas, such party shall promptly notify the other party.
4.3. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any Imbalance Charges.  If Buyer or Seller receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges, the parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges.  If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Buyer's actions or inactions (which shall include, but shall not be limited to, Buyer's failure to accept quantities of Gas equal to the Scheduled Gas), then Buyer shall pay for such Imbalance Charges, or reimburse Seller for such Imbalance Charges paid by Seller to the Transporter.  If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Seller's actions or inactions (which shall include, but shall not be limited to, Seller's failure to deliver quantities of Gas equal to the Scheduled Gas), then Seller shall pay for such Imbalance Charges, or reimburse Buyer for such Imbalance Charges paid by Buyer to the Transporter.
SECTION 5.  QUALITY AND MEASUREMENT
All Gas delivered by Seller shall meet the quality and heat content requirements of the Receiving Transporter.  The unit of quantity measurement for purposes of this Contract shall be one MMBtu dry.  Measurement of Gas quantities hereunder shall be in accordance with the established procedures of the Receiving Transporter.
SECTION 6.  TAXES

The parties have selected either the “Buyer Pays At and After Delivery Point” version or the “Seller Pays Before and At Delivery Point” version as indicated on the Base Contract.
Buyer Pays At and After Delivery Point:
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses or charges imposed by any government authority (“Taxes”) on or with respect to the Gas prior to the Delivery Point(s).  Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Gas at the Delivery Point(s) and all Taxes after the Delivery Point(s).  If a party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other party’s responsibility hereunder, the party responsible for such Taxes shall promptly reimburse the other party for such Taxes.  Any party entitled to an exemption from any such Taxes or charges shall furnish the other party any necessary documentation thereof.

If a party is required to remit or pay Taxes which are the other party’s responsibility hereunder, the party responsible for such Taxes shall promptly reimburse the other party for such Taxes.  Any party entitled to an exemption from any such Taxes or charges shall furnish the other party any necessary documentation thereof.
SECTION 7.  BILLING, PAYMENT AND AUDIT
7.1. Seller shall invoice Buyer for Gas delivered and received in the preceding Month and for any other applicable charges, providing supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount charged.  If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the billing date, billing will be prepared based on the quantity of Scheduled Gas.  The invoiced quantity will then be adjusted to the actual quantity on the following Month's billing or as soon thereafter as actual delivery information is available.
7.2. Buyer shall remit the amount due in the manner specified in the Base Contract, in immediately available funds, on or before the later of the Payment Date or 10 days after receipt of the invoice by Buyer; provided that if the Payment Date is not a Business Day, payment is due on the next Business Day following that date.  If Buyer fails to remit the full amount payable by it when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue at a rate equal to the lower of (i) the then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by The Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per annum from the date due until the date of payment; or (ii) the maximum applicable lawful interest rate.  If Buyer, in good faith, disputes the amount of any such statement or any part thereof, Buyer will pay to Seller such amount as it concedes to be correct; provided, however, if Buyer disputes the amount due, Buyer must provide supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount paid or disputed.
7.3. In the event any payments are due Buyer hereunder, payment to Buyer shall be made in accordance with Section 7.2. above.
7.4. A party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of the other party only to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under the Contract.  This examination right shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Contract.  All invoices and billings shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate unless objected to in writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two years after the Month of Gas delivery.  All retroactive adjustments under Section 7. shall be paid in full by the party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy.
SECTION 8.  TITLE, WARRANTY AND INDEMNITY
8.1. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, title to the Gas shall pass from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s).  Seller shall have responsibility for and assume any liability with respect to the Gas prior to its delivery to Buyer at the specified Delivery Point(s).  Buyer shall have responsibility for and assume any liability with respect to said Gas after its delivery to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s).
8.2. Seller warrants that it will have the right to convey and will transfer good and merchantable title to all Gas sold hereunder and delivered by it to Buyer, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims.
8.3. Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and save it harmless from all losses, liabilities or claims including attorneys' fees and costs of court ("Claims"), from any and all persons, arising from or out of claims of title, personal injury or property damage from said Gas or other charges thereon which attach before title passes to Buyer.  Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and save it harmless from all Claims, from any and all persons, arising from or out of claims regarding payment, personal injury or property damage from said Gas or other charges thereon which attach after title passes to Buyer.
8.4. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8., as between Seller and Buyer, Seller will be liable for all Claims to the extent that such arise from the failure of Gas delivered by Seller to meet the quality requirements of Section 5.
SECTION  9.  NOTICES
9.1. All Transaction Confirmations, invoices, payments and other communications made pursuant to the Base Contract ("Notices") shall be made to the addresses specified in writing by the respective parties from time to time.
9.2. All Notices required hereunder may be sent by facsimile or mutually acceptable electronic means, a nationally recognized 
 overnight courier service, first class mail or hand delivered.
9.3. Notice shall be given when received on a Business Day by the addressee.  In the absence of proof of the actual receipt date, the following presumptions will apply.  Notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed to have been received upon the sending party's receipt of its facsimile machine's confirmation of successful transmission, if the day on which such facsimile is received is not a Business Day or is after five p.m. on a Business Day, then such facsimile shall be deemed to have been received on the next following Business Day.  Notice by overnight mail or courier shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day after it was sent or such earlier time as is confirmed by the receiving party.  Notice via first class mail shall be considered delivered two Business Days after mailing.

SECTION  10.  FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
10.1. When reasonable grounds for insecurity of payment or title to the Gas arise, either party may demand adequate assurance of performance.  Adequate assurance shall mean sufficient security in the form and for the term reasonably specified by the party demanding assurance, including, but not limited to, a standby irrevocable letter of credit, a prepayment, a security interest in an asset acceptable to the demanding party or a performance bond or guarantee by a creditworthy entity.  In the event either party shall (i) make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (ii) default in the payment obligation to the other party; (iii) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize, or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors or have such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it; (iv) otherwise become bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced); or (v) be unable to pay its debts as they fall due; then the other party shall have the right to either withhold and/or suspend deliveries or payment, or terminate the Contract without prior notice, in addition to any and all other remedies available hereunder.  Seller may immediately suspend deliveries to Buyer hereunder in the event Buyer has not paid any amount due Seller hereunder on or before the second day following the date such payment is due.
10.2. Each party reserves to itself all rights, set-offs, counterclaims, and other defenses which it is or may be entitled to arising from the Contract.
SECTION 11.  FORCE MAJEURE
11.1. Except with regard to a party's obligation to make payment due under Section 7. and Imbalance Charges under Section 4, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform a Firm obligation, to the extent such failure was caused by Force Majeure.  The term "Force Majeure" as employed herein means any cause not reasonably within the control of the party claiming suspension, as further defined in Section 11.2.
11.2. Force Majeure shall include but not be limited to the following:  (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; (iii) interruption of firm transportation and/or storage by Transporters; (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars; and (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, or regulation promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction.  Seller and Buyer shall make reasonable efforts to avoid the adverse impacts of a Force Majeure and to resolve the event or occurrence once it has occurred in order to resume performance.
11.3. Neither party shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of Force Majeure to the extent performance is affected by any or all of the following circumstances:  (i) the curtailment of interruptible or secondary firm transportation unless primary, in-path, firm transportation is also curtailed; (ii) the party claiming excuse failed to remedy the condition and to resume the performance of such covenants or obligations with reasonable dispatch; or (iii) economic hardship.  The party claiming Force Majeure shall not be excused from its responsibility for Imbalance Charges.
11.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that the settlement of strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances shall be entirely within the sole discretion of the party experiencing such disturbance.
11.5. The party whose performance is prevented by Force Majeure must provide notice to the other party.  Initial notice may be given orally; however, written notification with reasonably full particulars of the event or occurrence is required as soon as reasonably possible.  Upon providing written notification of Force Majeure to the other party, the affected party will be relieved of its obligation to make or accept delivery of Gas as applicable to the extent and for the duration of Force Majeure, and neither party shall be deemed to have failed in such obligations to the other during such occurrence or event.
SECTION 12.  TERM
This Contract may be terminated on 30 days’ written notice, but shall remain in effect until the expiration of the latest Delivery Period of any Transaction Confirmation(s).  The rights of either party pursuant to Section 7.4., the obligations to make payment hereunder, and the obligation of either party to indemnify the other, pursuant hereto shall survive the termination of the Base Contract or any Transaction Confirmation.

SECTION 13.  MISCELLANEOUS
13.1. This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors, assigns, personal representatives, and heirs of the respective parties hereto, and the covenants, conditions, rights and obligations of this Contract shall run for the full term of this Contract.  No assignment of this Contract, in whole or in part, will be made without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, either party may transfer its interest to any parent or affiliate by assignment, merger or otherwise without the prior approval of the other party.  Upon any transfer and assumption, the transferor shall not be relieved of or discharged from any obligations hereunder.
13.2. If any provision in this Contract is determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable by any court having jurisdiction, such determination shall not invalidate, void, or make unenforceable any other provision, agreement or covenant of this Contract.
13.3. No waiver of any breach of this Contract shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
13.4. This Contract sets forth all understandings between the parties respecting each transaction subject hereto, and any prior contracts, understandings and representations, whether oral or written, relating to such transactions are merged into and superseded by this Contract and any effective Transaction Confirmation(s).  This Contract may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties.
13.5. The interpretation and performance of this Contract shall be governed by the laws of the state specified by the parties in the Base Contract, excluding, however, any conflict of laws rule which would apply the law of another jurisdiction.
13.6. This Contract and all provisions herein will be subject to all applicable and valid statutes, rules, orders and regulations of any Federal, State, or local governmental authority having jurisdiction over the parties, their facilities, or Gas supply, this Contract or Transaction Confirmation or any provisions thereof.
13.7. There is no third party beneficiary to this Contract.
13.8. Each party to this Contract represents and warrants that it has full and complete authority to enter into and perform this Contract.
