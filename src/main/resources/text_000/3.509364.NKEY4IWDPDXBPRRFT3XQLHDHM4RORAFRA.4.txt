Request for Proposal

As the marketing affiliate of a major producer of natural gas in North America, BP Energy Company is soliciting proposals for the sale of baseload gas supply on the Amoco and Red Cedar gathering systems in the  Durango, Colorado area of the San Juan Basin.

Interested parties may submit bids for the following package:

TERM: November 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002
        
DAILY CONTRACT Full-entitled share of wellhead production on a daily basis up to the full-entitled
QUANTITY  share of Amoco Production Company’s production from these wells, which is approximately 50,000 MMBtu/day. Buyer agrees to nominate and purchase the agreed upon Daily Contract Quantity for each Production Area on a firm daily basis and Seller agrees to supply Buyer’s nomination (within the Daily Contract Quantity) on a daily firm basis.  Seller will notify Buyer five business days prior to the first day of the following production month of the full-entitled share of wellhead production.

PRICING: Fixed, NYMEX basis, or Index based pricing terms.   

DELIVERY POINT(S): At the wellheads of the wells identified on Exhibit “A”
   
REMEDIES: If on any day Buyer fails to nominate for delivery the Daily Contract Quantity to as many cycles as may be needed to sell the gas, during the term of this Agreement, Seller may cancel this Agreement and market gas itself.         

PAYMENT: Seller shall invoice Buyer, by facsimile, based on nominated quantities of gas delivered and sold to Buyer at the Point(s) of Delivery. Buyer shall make payment within ten (10) days of receipt of such invoice.

CONTRACT TERMS: The Buyer(s) selected by BP Energy Company will be required to execute a Base Gas Sales Contract (enclosed) prior to gas flowing.  Gas will not flow unless the Base Gas Sales Contract is executed by both parties.


CREDIT APPROVAL:   Buyer’s credit will be subject to Seller’s credit review prior to the completion of any transaction and Buyer agrees to provide any financial information or security required by such review.  If Buyer’s creditworthiness or financial responsibility become unsatisfactory at any time during the contract term, based solely on Seller’s judgment, Seller may require satisfactory security before further deliveries are made or, if such security is not provided, cancel the contract.

TRANSPORTATION   Buyer shall be responsible for all mid-stream and mainline transportation COSTS:   costs downstream of the point of sale.

The gas being offered to the Buyer may at Buyer’s option be moved under certain gathering agreements that are currently held by BP. These agreements state the terms under which the gas is gathered from the wells, treated, and compressed for delivery to the mainline.  Even though Buyer will be taking delivery of gas at the wells connected to these systems, for gas moved pursuant to these gathering agreements Seller will pay the costs associated with these mid-stream services according to the terms of these agreements which may be in effect from time to time. Buyer may also elect to utilize midstream services provided by Seller.  Buyer will reimburse Seller for these midstream service costs based on the different heat contents of the gas and the different mid-stream costs and fuel for each Production Area. Currently, these costs are :

 Production Area  Heat Content Mid-Stream Cost  Fuel Rate PLA-9  846 btu/mcf $0.66/mmbtu  7.65%
 Empanada  902 btu/mcf $0.61/mmbtu  7.25%
 Area 6   949 btu/mcf $0.58/mmbtu  2.00%



THIS LETTER IS A STATEMENT OF INTENT ONLY, AND DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY LEGALLY BINDING OBLIGATIONS ON EITHER OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND IS NOT AN OFFER, THE ACCEPTANCE OF WHICH WOULD FORM A BINDING AGREEMENT.   THE PARTIES HERETO INTEND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND ONLY UPON NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF AN AGREEMENT ACCEPTABLE IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE TO BOTH SIDES.
