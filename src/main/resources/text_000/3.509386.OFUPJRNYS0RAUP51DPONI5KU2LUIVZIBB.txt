Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

Melinda
