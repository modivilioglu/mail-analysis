Dear Sirs:

 On November 28, 2001, we sent Enron North America Corporation and Enron Capital Trade & Resources Corporation (hereinafter referred to collectively as “Enron”) through the persons copied below by fax, email and hard copies of Kennedy’s letter demanding Enron comply with Paragraph 1 of the Amendment to Gas Purchase Agreement (Reserves Commitment/Index Pricing), which is an amendment to that Gas Purchase Agreement (Reserves Commitment/Index Pricing) dated 27th day of August 1999 between Enron Capital Trade & Resources Corporation and Kennedy Oil.  The amendment is between Kennedy Oil and Enron North America Corporation.  As advised in that letter, it was necessary for Enron to immediately collateralize its debt to Kennedy Oil and Enron has made no positive response to that demand.  

 Accordingly, as Enron is in a breach of the agreement, Kennedy Oil is terminating the Gas Purchase Agreement (Reserves Commitment/Index Pricing) dated August 27, 1999 and will begin selling its gas to a different entity effective immediately.  

 If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

      Very truly yours,



      THOMAS F. REESE
      Attorney for Kennedy Oil
