Thank you very much for your inquiry regarding your stay at the Little Nell.

side at the rate of $400 per night, a standard room on the mountain side at
the rate of $450 per night, a premium room on the town side available at the
rate of $500 per night, and a premium room on the mountain side available at
the rate of $550 per night. We have a 4 night minimum stay required over the

Our concierge or our spa attendant would be happy to arrange a massage
appointment for you either in the spa or in your room.
Kindly please let me know if you would like me to book any of these rooms
for you. We require a 50% deposit of room and tax at the time of booking and

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
