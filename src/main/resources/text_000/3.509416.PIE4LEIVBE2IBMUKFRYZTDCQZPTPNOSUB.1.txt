Re: Gas Purchase Agreement Dated as of August 31, 1999, as amended (the “Gas Purchase Agreement”) between Sapphire Bay, L.L.C. and Independent Production Company, Inc. (collectively, “Seller”) and Enron North America Corp. (formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., as “Buyer”)

Dear Sirs:

Pursuant to the Amendment to the above-referenced Gas Purchase Agreement dated November 27, 2001 (copy enclosed), Enron North America Corp. (“Enron”) covenanted, upon Seller’s request, to establish a letter of credit in an amount equal to all amounts due under the Gas Purchase Agreement.  We hereby request that Enron immediately establish such a letter of credit in the amount of $950,000.00 for the benefit of Independent Production Company, Inc. and Sapphire Bay, L.L.C. (the “Seller”).  The requested amount of the letter of credit reflects an estimate of the amount currently owed by Enron to the Seller for gas production delivered to Enron during the period from and including November 1, 2001 to and including November 28, 2001, the date on which the Gas Purchase Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms.

Sincerely,

INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION COMPANY, INC.

On behalf of itself and Sapphire Bay, L.L.C.
