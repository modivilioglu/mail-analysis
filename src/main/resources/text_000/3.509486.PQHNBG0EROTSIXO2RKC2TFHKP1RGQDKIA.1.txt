ENFOLIOÂ® MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT        
II
___________________, a ______________ corporation ("Company"), and ______________, a ____________ ____________ ("Customer"), referred to collectively as the "Parties," enter into this Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement (together with all Transactions, collectively, this "Agreement") effective as of the ___ Day of _________, ____ (the "Effective Date").  The ENFOLIO General Provisions set forth in Appendix "1" shall apply to this Agreement.


ARTICLE 1. TERM  This Agreement shall govern all Transactions and be in effect for a term of one year from the Effective Date.  It shall then continue in effect from Month to Month, unless terminated by either Party upon 30 Days prior written notice to the other Party; provided, this Agreement shall continue to apply to all Transactions then in effect until all Transactions are completed.  Termination of this Agreement in all instances shall be subject to Section 8.4.


ARTICLE 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT  2.1. Scope of Agreement.  Company and Customer from time to time during the term hereof may, but are not obligated to, enter into Transactions for the firm purchase and sale of Gas to which this Agreement shall apply.  Each Transaction shall be effectuated and evidenced as set forth in this Article 2 and shall constitute a part of this Agreement and all Transactions, together with this Agreement, shall constitute a single integrated agreement.  It is acknowledged that the Parties are relying upon the fact that all Transactions, together with this Agreement, will form a single integrated agreement and that the Parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.  Each Transaction shall be construed as one with this Agreement and any discrepancy between this Agreement and a Transaction shall be resolved in favor of the Transaction.  Each Transaction shall provide whether the Transaction is based upon DCQ quantity obligations or MinMQ or MinDQ and MaxDQ quantity obligations, in which case the applicable alternative definitions and provisions set forth in this Agreement shall apply.         

2.2. Transaction Procedures.  It is the intent of the Parties to facilitate Transactions in accordance with the agreed procedures in this Article 2 and assure that such Transactions are valid and enforceable as a result of the use of these procedures for the mutual benefit of the Parties.  Any Transaction may be formed and effectuated (i) by a written paper-based Transaction Agreement executed by the Parties (including by facsimile and/or counterparts) or (ii) in a recorded telephone conversation between the Parties occurring on any Business Day during the Pricing Hours whereby an offer and acceptance shall constitute the agreement of the Parties to a Transaction as evidenced by the Transaction Tape; provided, each Party may stipulate by prior notice to the other Party that any particular contemplated Transaction may be effectuated and formed only by means of procedure (i) above.  The Parties shall be legally bound by each Transaction from the time they agree to its terms in accordance with this Article 2 and acknowledge that each Party will rely thereon in doing business related to the Transaction.  The Transaction Tape is adopted by the Parties as a means by which a Transaction is reduced to tangible form, and the Parties to a Transaction are identified and authenticate a Transaction.  Any Transaction formed and effectuated pursuant to the foregoing shall be considered to be a "writing" or "in writing" and to have been "signed" and any Transaction Tape shall be considered to constitute an "original" document evidencing the Transaction.  Each Party consents to the recording of its employees' telephone conversations without any further notice.  SEE RIDER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT REQUIRED   

2.3. Equipment and Transaction Tape.  Company shall at its expense maintain equipment necessary to regularly record Transactions on Transaction Tapes and retain Transaction Tapes in such manner as to protect its business records from improper access; provided, Company shall not be liable for any malfunction of equipment or the operation thereof in respect of any Transaction WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE.  No Transaction shall be vitiated should a malfunction occur in equipment regularly utilized for recording Transactions or retaining Transaction Tapes or the operation thereof, and in such event, the Transaction shall be evidenced by the written and computer records of the Parties concerning the Transaction made contemporaneously with the telephone conversation.

2.4. Confirmations.  In addition to, but not in lieu of, the foregoing, the Parties agree that Company may confirm a recorded telephonic Transaction by forwarding to Customer a facsimile Confirmation and that a reasonable time for the receipt by Customer of a Confirmation is within 24 hours of the Transaction formation.  Company does hereby adopt its letterhead, including its address, as its signature on any Confirmation as the identification of Company and authentication by Company of the Confirmation, and such letterhead shall be sufficient to verify that Company originated the Confirmation.  The Parties agree that any objections to the contents of the Confirmation shall be made in writing on or before the Confirm Deadline for all purposes hereunder and at law.  Upon issuance of a Confirmation and the passage of the Confirm Deadline, if no objection to the Confirmation has been then received, the Confirmation shall be conclusive evidence of the Transaction made the subject matter thereof and the final expression of all of its terms.

2.5. Enforcement of Transactions.  The Parties agree not to contest or assert a defense to the validity or enforceability of telephonic Transactions entered into in accordance with this Agreement under laws relating to (i) whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the Party to be thereby bound or (ii) the authority of any employee of the Party if the employee name is stated in the Transaction Tape.


ARTICLE 3.  QUANTITY OBLIGATIONS   3.1. Seller's Sales Obligation.  Seller shall Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, at the Delivery Point(s) on a firm basis each Gas Day a quantity of Gas equal to the quantity properly requested by Buyer up to the DCQ or MaxDQ, if applicable ("Buyer's Requested Quantity").  Unless otherwise agreed nothing in this Agreement, and in particular this Article 3, shall require or permit either Party to Schedule Gas at a point other than a Delivery Point or in excess of the DCQ, Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity or MaxDQ, as applicable.

3.2. Seller's Failure to Schedule.  If on any Gas Day Seller fails to Schedule Buyer's Requested Quantity, then such occurrence shall constitute a "Seller's Deficiency Default" and "Seller's Deficiency Quantity" shall be the numerical difference between Buyer's Requested Quantity and the amount of Gas Scheduled for such Gas Day.  In the event of a Seller's Deficiency Default, Seller shall pay Buyer the sum of the following:  (i) an amount equal to the product of the Seller's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15 multiplied by Seller's Deficiency Quantity to cover Buyer's administrative and operational costs.  During any Month in which Seller's nonperformance continues for a period of five consecutive Gas Days Buyer may elect upon notice to Seller, without liability, not to recommence Scheduling Gas hereunder for the remainder of such Month, but for no longer period.  Subject to offset pursuant to Section 3.5, payment to Buyer shall be made on the 25th Day of the Month in which Seller receives Buyer's statement for same.   

3.3. Buyer's Purchase Obligation.  Buyer shall Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, at the Delivery Point(s) on a firm basis each Gas Day a quantity of Gas equal to the DCQ; provided, (i) if the MinMQ is applicable to a Transaction, Buyer shall Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, at the Delivery Point(s) on a firm basis each Month a minimum quantity of Gas equal to the MinMQ and (ii) if the MinDQ is applicable to a Transaction, Buyer shall Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, at the Delivery Point(s) on a firm basis each Day a minimum quantity of Gas equal to the MinDQ.

3.4. Buyer's Failure to Schedule.  If on any Gas Day Buyer fails to Schedule the DCQ or MinDQ, if applicable, then such occurrence shall constitute a "Buyer's Deficiency Default" and "Buyer's Deficiency Quantity" shall be the numerical difference between the DCQ or MinDQ, if applicable, and the quantity of Gas Scheduled for such Gas Day; provided, if the MinMQ is applicable to a Transaction, (i) the Buyer's Deficiency Default shall occur if Buyer fails to Schedule the MinMQ for any Month and (ii) the Buyer's Deficiency Quantity shall be the numerical difference between the MinMQ and the quantity of Gas Scheduled for such Month.  In the event of a Buyer's Deficiency Default, Buyer shall pay Seller the sum of the following:  (i) an amount equal to the product of Buyer's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15 multiplied by Buyer's Deficiency Quantity to cover Seller's administrative and operational costs.  With respect to DCQ and MinDQ obligations, during any Month in which Buyer's nonperformance continues for a period of five consecutive Gas Days Seller may elect upon notice to Buyer, without liability, not to recommence Scheduling Gas for the remainder of such Month, but for no longer period.  Subject to offset pursuant to Section 3.5, payment to Seller shall be made in accordance with the Financial Matters provisions set forth in Appendix "1."

3.5. Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.


ARTICLE 4.  DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES  4.1. Early Termination.  If a Triggering Event (defined in Section 4.2) occurs with respect to either Party at any time during the term of this Agreement, the other Party (the "Notifying Party") may (i) upon two Business Days written notice to the first Party, which notice shall be given no later than 60 Days after the discovery of the occurrence of the Triggering Event, establish a date on which any or all Transactions selected by it and this Agreement in respect thereof will terminate ("Early Termination Date") except as provided in Section 8.4, and (ii) withhold any payments due in respect of such Transactions; provided, upon the occurrence of any Triggering Event listed in item (iv) of Section 4.2 as it may apply to any party, all Transactions and this Agreement in respect thereof shall automatically terminate, without notice, as if an Early Termination Date had been immediately declared except as provided in Section 8.4.  If an Early Termination Date occurs, the Notifying Party shall in good faith calculate its damages, including its associated costs and attorneys' fees, resulting from the termination of the terminated Transactions (the "Termination Payment").  The Termination Payment will be determined by (i) comparing the value of (a) the remaining term, quantities and prices under each such Transaction had it not been terminated to (b) the equivalent quantities and relevant market prices for the remaining term either quoted by a bona fide third party offer or which are reasonably expected to be available in the market under a replacement contract for each such Transaction and (ii) ascertaining the associated costs and attorneys' fees.  To ascertain the market prices of a replacement contract the Notifying Party may consider, among other valuations, any or all of the settlement prices of NYMEX Gas futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in Gas swap contracts and other bona fide third party offers, all adjusted for the length of the remaining term and the basis differential.  All terminated Transactions shall be netted against each other.  The Notifying Party shall give the Affected Party (defined in Section 4.2) written notice of the amount of the Termination Payment, inclusive of a statement showing its determination.  If a Termination Payment is owed to the Notifying Party, the Affected Party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Notifying Party within 10 Days of receipt of such notice.  If a Termination Payment is owed to the Affected Party, the Notifying Party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Affected Party within 10 Days of Affected Partyâs receipt of such notice.  At the time for payment of any amount due under this Article 4, each Party shall pay to the other Party all additional amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreement, but all such amounts shall be netted and aggregated with any Termination Payment payable hereunder.  If the Affected Party disagrees with the calculation of the Termination Payment, the issue shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Agreement and the resulting Termination Payment shall be due and payable within three Days after the award.  If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under this Agreement or otherwise).

4.2. Triggering Event shall mean, with respect to a Party (the "Affected Party"):  (i) the failure by the Affected Party to make, when due, any payment required under this Agreement if such failure is not remedied within five Business Days after written notice of such failure is given to the Affected Party; provided, the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute as described in the Billing and Payment provisions or (ii) any representation or warranty made by the Affected Party in this Agreement shall prove to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated or (iii) the failure by the Affected Party to perform any covenant set forth in this Agreement (other than its obligations to make any payment or obligations which are otherwise specifically covered in this Section 4.2 as a separate Triggering Event), and such failure is not excused by Force Majeure or cured within five Business Days after written notice thereof to the Affected Party or (iv) the Affected Party shall (a) make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, (b) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, (c) otherwise become bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced) or (d) be unable to pay its debts as they fall due or (v) Seller's unexcused failure to Schedule the Buyer's Requested Quantity requested by Buyer for a cumulative period of 30 or more Gas Days in a 12 Month period in any one Transaction or (vi) Buyer's unexcused failure to Schedule the DCQ or MinDQ for a cumulative period of 30 or more Gas Days in a 12 Month period in any one Transaction, or, if applicable, the MinMQ for a cumulative period of three Months in a 12 Month period in any one Transaction. [, or] SEE RIDER EVENTS

4.3. Other Events.  In the event Buyer under a Transaction is regulated by a federal, state or local regulatory body, and such body shall disallow all or any portion of any costs incurred or yet to be incurred by Buyer under any provision of this Agreement, such action shall not operate to excuse Buyer from performance of any obligation nor shall such action give rise to any right of Buyer to any refund or retroactive adjustment of the Contract Price provided in any Transaction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Affected Party's activities hereunder become subject to regulation of any kind whatsoever under any law (other than with respect to New Taxes) to a greater or different extent than that existing on the Effective Date and such regulation either (i) renders this Agreement illegal or unenforceable or (ii) materially adversely affects the business of the Affected Party, with respect to its financial position or otherwise, then in the case of (i) above, either Party, and in the case of (ii) above, only the Affected Party, shall at such time have the right to declare an Early Termination Date in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided, notwithstanding the rights of the Parties to declare an Early Termination Date as above stated, the Affected Party shall be liable for payment of the Termination Payment calculated by the non-Affected Party as provided in Section 4.1.

4.4. Offset.  Each Party reserves to itself all rights, set-offs, counterclaims and other remedies and defenses consistent with Section 8.3 (to the extent not expressly herein waived or denied) which such Party has or may be entitled.  All outstanding Transactions and the obligations to make payment in connection therewith or under this Agreement may be offset against each other, set off or recouped therefrom.


ARTICLE 5.  FORCE MAJEURE  This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted under this Agreement and all other excuses at law or in equity are WAIVED to the extent permitted by law.  Except with respect to payment obligations, in the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such Party's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent they are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and during the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The Party receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Day period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder and both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform.  The cause of the Force Majeure shall be remedied with all reasonable diligence and dispatch; provided, unless otherwise agreed no provision herein shall require or permit Seller or Buyer to Schedule quantities of Gas (i) in excess of the DCQ, Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity or MaxDQ, as applicable, or (ii) at points other than the Delivery Point(s).  


ARTICLE 6.  TAXES  6.1. Allocation of and Indemnity for Taxes.  The Contract Price includes full reimbursement for, and Seller is liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, or reimburse Buyer if Buyer has paid, all Taxes applicable to the Gas sold upstream of the Delivery Point(s).  In the event Buyer is required to remit such Tax, the amount thereof shall be deducted from any sums becoming due to Seller hereunder. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from any Claims for such Taxes.  The Contract Price does not include reimbursement for, and Buyer is liable for and shall pay, cause to be paid, or reimburse Seller if Seller has paid, all Taxes applicable to the Gas sold downstream of or at the Delivery Point(s), including any Taxes imposed or collected by a taxing authority with jurisdiction over Buyer.  Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any Claims for such Taxes.

6.2. New Taxes.  A.  If (i) a New Tax occurs and (ii) Buyer or Seller would be responsible for such New Tax if it were a Tax under Section 6.1 and (iii) such New Tax is, due to and on the basis of laws, regulations and applicable contracts of Buyer in effect as of the effective date of the New Tax, of the type which Buyer can pass directly through to, or be reimbursed by, another person or entity in the chain of Gas supply, such Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, or reimburse Seller if Seller has paid, all such New Taxes and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any Claims for such Taxes; provided, if Buyer does not identify its contracts for long-term fixed sourcing in the ordinary course of its business and cannot identify applicable contracts, this Paragraph A shall not apply.  B.  If (i) a New Tax occurs and (ii) either Buyer or Seller would be responsible for such New Tax if it were a Tax under Section 6.1, and (iii) Paragraph A does not apply, such responsible Buyer or Seller (the "Taxed Party") shall be entitled to declare an Early Termination Date in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement subject to the following conditions; provided, prior to and including the initial Agreement Period (below defined) invoked under this Section 6.2, New Taxes shall be allocated as if they were Taxes as provided in Section 6.1:  (a) the Taxed Party must give the non-Taxed Party at least 30 Days prior written notice (the "Agreement Period") of its intent to declare an Early Termination Date (and which notice shall be given no later than 90 Days after the later of the enactment or effective date of the relevant New Tax), and prior to the proposed Early Termination Date Buyer and Seller shall attempt to reach a mutual agreement as to the sharing of the New Tax, (b) if a mutual sharing agreement is not reached, the non-Taxed Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon written notice to the Taxed Party within the Agreement Period, to pay the New Tax for any continuous period it so elects on a Month to Month basis, and in such case the Taxed Party shall not have the right during such continuous period to declare the Early Termination Date on the basis of the New Taxes, (c) should the non-Taxed Party at its election agree to pay the New Tax on a Month to Month basis, then upon 30 Days prior written notice to the Taxed Party of its election to cease payment of such New Tax, the Taxed Party shall then be liable for the payment of the New Tax and the Parties shall again be subject to this Section 6.2 as if the New Tax had an effective date as of the date the non-Taxed Party ceases payment of such New Tax, (d) if a mutual sharing agreement is not reached and the non-Taxed Party does not elect to pay the New Tax for any period of time within the Agreement Period, the Early Termination Date shall take effect and all Transactions must be terminated and be subject to the same Early Termination Date, (e) the Early Termination Date shall be effected as if a Triggering Event had occurred and the Termination Payment calculated as set forth in Section 4.1 shall be payable; provided, both Seller and Buyer pursuant to Section 4.1 shall calculate their respective Termination Payments resulting from the termination of all Transactions as if they each were a Notifying Party; provided further, if the calculation of the Termination Payments results in either the non-Taxed Party's or the Taxed Party's having either a gain or loss (after netting its gains against its losses), the Parties shall share equally such net gain due, or be responsible to pay to the Party having the net loss, one-half of the Termination Payment and (f) such Termination Payment shall be payable as provided in Section 4.1 and its calculation shall be subject to arbitration as provided in the ENFOLIO General Provisions.

6.3.  Cooperation.  Upon request, a Party shall provide a certificate of exemption or other evidence of exemption from any Tax and each Party agrees to cooperate with the other in obtaining an exemption and minimizing Taxes payable in respect of all Transactions.


ARTICLE 7.  TITLE, RISK OF LOSS, INDEMNITY AND BALANCING  7.1. Title, Risk of Loss and Indemnity. As between the Parties, Seller shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of Gas Scheduled hereunder and responsible for any damage or injury caused thereby prior to the time the same shall have been delivered to Buyer.  After delivery of Gas to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s), Buyer shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession thereof and responsible for any injury or damage caused thereby.  Title to Gas Scheduled hereunder shall pass from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s).  Seller and Buyer each assumes all liability for and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims, including injury to and death of persons, arising from any act or incident occurring when title to the Gas is vested in the Indemnifying Party.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THIS INDEMNITY AND THE LIABILITY ASSUMED UNDER IT BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES THEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE; PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM TO THE EXTENT SAME RESULTED FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR BAD FAITH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

7.2. Correction of Imbalances, Cashouts and Penalties.  Differences between Scheduled quantities and actual quantities delivered and received hereunder ("Imbalances") will be corrected or settled in cash or Gas or by offset as the Parties agree.  Additionally, in the event of (i) an Imbalance on Buyer's Transporter's system caused by Seller or Seller's Transporter's delivery of less or more than the Scheduled quantity for any Gas Day (in which case Seller shall be the "Responsible Party") or (ii) an Imbalance on Seller's Transporter's system caused by Buyer or Buyer's Transporter's receipt of more or less than the Scheduled quantity for any Gas Day (in which case Buyer shall be the "Responsible Party"), the Responsible Party shall be liable for and reimburse to the other Party any associated Transporter penalties or cashout costs and losses incurred by such other Party.  In the event the tariff of either Buyer's or Seller's Transporter provides for cashouts on the basis of the aggregation of all overdeliveries and underdeliveries between such Transporter and Buyer or Seller, respectively (the "Aggregate Transporter Imbalance"), and the nature of the Imbalance (overdelivery or underdelivery) attributable to the Responsible Party is the same as the Aggregate Transporter Imbalance (overdelivery or underdelivery), the Responsible Party shall participate in the other Party's cashout settlement of the Aggregate Transporter Imbalance on the basis of only the Responsible Party's pro-rata share thereof.  


ARTICLE 8.  MISCELLANEOUS  8.1. Notices.  All notices, including, without limitation, consents, and communications made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made as specified in Exhibit "A."  Notices required to be in writing shall be delivered in written form by letter, facsimile or other documentary form.  Notice by facsimile or hand delivery shall be deemed to have been received by the close of the Business Day on which it was transmitted or hand delivered (unless transmitted or hand delivered after close in which case it shall be deemed received at the close of the next Business Day) or such earlier time confirmed by the receiving Party.  Notice by overnight mail or courier shall be deemed to have been received two Business Days after it was sent or such earlier time confirmed by the receiving Party.  Any notices given hereunder in respect of the declaration of an Early Termination Date shall be also sent to the address or facsimile number so specified in Exhibit "A."  Any Party may change its addresses by providing notice of same in accordance herewith. 

8.2. Transfer.  This Agreement, including, without limitation, each indemnification, shall inure to and bind the permitted successors and assigns of the Parties; provided, neither Party shall transfer this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party which may be withheld entirely at the option of such Party; provided further, either Party may, without the consent of the other Party (and without relieving itself from liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement or the accounts, revenues or proceeds hereof in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to any Affiliate by assignment, merger or otherwise, or (iii) transfer or assign this Agreement to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets of such Party.  Any Party's transfer in violation of this Section 8.2 shall be void.

8.3. Limitation of Remedies, Liability and Damages and Mitigation.  THE PARTIES DO HEREBY CONFIRM THAT THE EXPRESS REMEDIES AND MEASURES OF DAMAGES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES HEREOF.  FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS HEREIN PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER, THE OBLIGOR'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.  IF NO REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, THE OBLIGOR'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES ONLY, SUCH DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.  UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, IN TORT, CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY PENALTIES OR CHARGES ASSESSED BY ANY TRANSPORTER OR OTHER ENTITY FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED RECEIPT OF GAS BY THE OTHER PARTY.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE.  TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE LIQUIDATED, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT AND THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE HARM OR LOSS.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND IS CONTRACTING FOR THE GOODS TO BE SUPPLIED BY SELLER BASED SOLELY UPON THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES HEREIN SET FORTH AND SUBJECT TO SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, ACCEPTS SUCH GOODS "AS-IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS."  SELLER EXPRESSLY NEGATES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS UNDER, ARISING OUT OF OR ASSOCIATED WITH TEXAS & BUSINESS COMMERCE CODE SECTIONS 17.41 THROUGH 17.63 KNOWN AS THE DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.  The Parties acknowledge the duty to mitigate damages hereunder.   In this connection, the Parties recognize that the ability to effectuate arrangements for the sale or purchase of Gas is conditioned upon the volatility of Gas markets, the creditworthiness and reliability of  potential customers, the complexity and size of the portfolios of contracts managed by each Party and the need to conduct market business in an orderly manner.  Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three Business Days is a commercially reasonable period to purchase or sell Gas in respect of a Seller's or Buyer's Deficiency Default and (ii) three Business Days after the end of the Month in which the Early Termination Date occurs is a commercially reasonable period after the establishment of an Early Termination Date to determine the Termination Payment; provided, notwithstanding the foregoing, if Gas volumes made the basis of a Seller's or Buyer's Deficiency Default or a Party's determination of the Termination Payment are in excess of 20,000 MMBtu/Gas Day, the Parties recognize that a longer period may ordinarily be required to effectuate cover or determine the Termination Payment in an orderly manner so as not to adversely affect the Gas market.   Each Party may utilize its discretion, with commercially reasonable foresight, to adjust the timing and staggering of the purchases or sales of Gas volumes in its efforts to mitigate damages.  No claim that a Party failed to mitigate damages shall be grounded solely on the basis of counter Gas market movement.       

8.4. Winding Up Arrangements.  Upon the expiration of the Parties' sale and purchase obligations under this Agreement, any monies, penalties or other charges due and owing Seller shall be paid, any corrections or adjustments to payments previously made shall be determined, and any refunds due Buyer made, within 60 Days.  Any Imbalances in receipts or deliveries shall be corrected to zero balance within 60 Days.  All indemnity and confidentiality obligations and audit rights shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  The Parties' obligations provided in this Agreement shall remain in effect for the purpose of complying herewith.
 
8.5. Applicable Law.  THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH TRANSACTION AND THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED, ENFORCED AND PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL TRANSACTIONS SHALL BE ACCEPTED AND FORMED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES HEREIN SET FORTH.

8.6. Document, Record Retention and Evidence.  This Agreement, the Exhibits and Appendices hereto, if any, and each Transaction, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter contemplated by this Agreement.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral or written) affecting the subject matter other than those herein expressed.  Other than with respect to Transactions entered into in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement and as otherwise herein expressly stated (the "Transaction Procedures"), no amendment or modification to this Agreement shall be enforceable, unless reduced to writing and executed by both Parties.  The conduct of the Parties in accordance with the Transaction Procedures shall evidence a course of dealing and a course of performance accepted by the Parties in furtherance of this Agreement and all Transactions entered into by the Parties.  The provisions of this Agreement shall not impart rights enforceable by any person, firm or organization not a Party or not bound as a Party, or not a permitted successor or assignee of a Party bound to this Agreement.  Except as otherwise herein stated, any provision, article or section declared or rendered unlawful by a court of law or regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the Parties or deemed unlawful because of a statutory change will not otherwise affect the lawful obligations that arise under this Agreement.  The headings used for the Articles herein are for convenience and reference purposes only.  All Exhibits and Appendices referenced in this Agreement, if any, are incorporated.  Any original executed Agreement or Transaction Agreement may be photocopied and stored on computer tapes and disks (the "Imaged Agreement").  The Imaged Agreement, if introduced as evidence on paper, the Confirmation, if introduced as evidence in automated facsimile form, and the Transaction Tape, if introduced as evidence in its original form and as transcribed onto paper, and all computer records of the foregoing, if introduced as evidence in printed format, in any judicial, arbitration, mediation or administrative proceedings, will be admissible as between the Parties to the same extent and under the same conditions as other business records originated and maintained in documentary form. Neither Party shall object to the admissibility of the Transaction Tape, the Confirmation or the Imaged Agreement (or photocopies of the transcription of the Transaction Tape, the Confirmation or the Imaged Agreement) on the basis that such were not originated or maintained in documentary form under either the hearsay rule, the best evidence rule or other rule of evidence.

8.7.  Forward Contract.

Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer against all Claims to or against the title of said Gas.  In the event any Claim is asserted to said Gas, Buyer, in addition to other remedies, may suspend its obligation to pay for said Gas up to the amount of such Claim.
Â·Alternate Price Redetermination If any or all of the indices used to determine the Spot Price or the Contract Price are not available in the future, the Parties agree to promptly negotiate a mutually satisfactory alternate index for the Spot Price or Contract Price (each an "Alternate Price").  If the Parties cannot agree by the end of the first Month for which the Spot Price or Contract Price could not be determined, then Seller and Buyer shall each prepare a prioritized list of up to five alternative published reference postings or prices representative of spot prices for Gas delivered in the same geographic area.  Each Party shall submit its list to the other within 10 Days after the end of the first Month for which the price could not be determined.

If no common indices appear on the lists, each Party shall submit a new list adding two indices within 10 Days.  If either Party fails to provide timely a list, such Party's list shall not be considered.  From and after the "Renegotiation Date," which shall be the date the Spot Price or Contract Price is no longer available, until the Alternate Price is determined, the Alternate Price shall be the average of the Spot Price(s) or Contract Price(s) in effect during the 12 Months preceding the Month in which the Renegotiation Date occurred, which price shall be effective until the Alternate Price is determined.  Upon determination of a new Alternate Price, the Spot Price or Contract Price, as applicable, will be adjusted retroactively to the Renegotiation Date.
Â·Effect of Waiver or Consent No waiver or consent by either Party, express or implied, of any one or more defaults by the other Party in the performance of any provision of this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver or consent of any other default or defaults whether of a like or different nature.  Failure by a Party to complain of any act of the other Party or to declare the other Party in default with respect to this Agreement, regardless of how long that failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by that Party of its rights with respect to that default until the applicable statute of  limitations period has run.
Â·Indemnifications With respect to each indemnification included in this Agreement the indemnity is given to the extent authorized by law and the following provisions shall be considered applicable.  The Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the investigation and defense thereof, including the employment of counsel, and shall be obligated to pay the related attorneys' fees; provided, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of  any Claim, however, the attorneys' fees of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless the employment of such counsel has been consented to in writing by the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in a timely manner; provided further, if the named parties to any Claim include both Parties, and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be a legal defense available to it which is different from those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party may elect to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay all attorneys' fees of such counsel and shall not have the right to assume the defense of the Claim on behalf of the Indemnified Party.  The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate in the defense of any Claim.  The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of a Claim without its express written consent thereto.  The Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for payments made or costs incurred in respect of an indemnity with the proceeds of any judgment, insurance, bond, surety or other recovery made with respect to an event covered by the indemnity.
Â·Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated.  Any and all claims, demands, causes of action, disputes, controversies, and other matters in question arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of its provisions, or the relationship between the Parties created by this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, whether provided by statute or the common law, for damages or any other relief, including, without limitation, all Claims (all of which are referred to herein as "Disputes"), shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  The arbitration may be initiated by either Party by providing to the other a written notice of arbitration specifying the Disputes to be arbitrated.

The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in Houston, Texas, or other location mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Within 30 Days of the notice initiating the arbitration procedure, each Party shall designate one arbitrator, who need not be impartial.  If a Party fails to designate an arbitrator, the other Party may have an arbitrator appointed by applying to the senior active United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas.  The two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator.  If the two arbitrators chosen by the Parties fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, both or either of the Parties may apply to the senior active United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas for the appointment of a third arbitrator.

In deciding the substance of the partiesâ Disputes, the arbitrators shall apply the substantive laws of the State of Texas (excluding Texas choice-of-law principles that might call for the application of some other Stateâs law).  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, except as modified in this Agreement.  It is contemplated that although the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, the arbitration proceeding will be self-administered by the Parties; provided, if a Party believes the process will be enhanced if it is administered by the American Arbitration Association, such Party shall have the right to cause the process to become administered by the American Arbitration Association by applying to the American Arbitration Association and, thereafter, the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the administration of the American Arbitration Association.  In determining the extent of discovery, the number and length of depositions, and all other pre-hearing matters, the arbitrators shall endeavor to the extent possible to streamline the proceedings and minimize the time and cost of the proceedings. There shall be no transcript of the hearing.  The final hearing shall be conducted within 120 days of the selection of the third arbitrator.  The final hearing shall not exceed 10 Business Days, with each Party to be granted one-half of the allocated time to present its case to the arbitrators. All proceedings conducted hereunder and the decision of the arbitrators shall be kept confidential by the Parties.
Arbitration Award.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded.  It is expressly agreed that the arbitrators shall have no authority to award treble, exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under Texas law,  the Parties hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover treble, exemplary or punitive damages in connection with any Dispute, either in arbitration or in litigation.  The arbitrators shall render their final decision within 20 Days of the completion of the final hearing fully resolving all of the Disputes that are the subject of the arbitration proceeding.  The arbitratorsâ ultimate decision after final hearing shall be in writing.  The arbitrators shall certify in their decision that no part of their award includes any amount for treble, exemplary or punitive damages not allowed hereunder.  The arbitratorsâ decision shall be final and non-appealable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Any and all of the arbitratorsâ orders and decisions may be enforceable in, and judgment upon any award rendered in the arbitration proceeding may be confirmed and entered by, any federal or state court having jurisdiction.
Â·Authority for Transactions Each Party represents to the other Party that each of its employees has authority to enter into Transactions pursuant to this Agreement on its behalf.  Identification and authority of a Party's employee engaging in a recorded telephonic Transaction shall be conclusively established for all purposes by a statement on the Transaction Tape by the employee of the employee's name; provided, failure to state the employee name shall not evidence any lack of authority of the employee to effectuate and form a Transaction. 
Â·Flexible Pricing During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction expressly providing for "Flexible Pricing" Customer may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed Price, Fixed Basis Price or Floating Basis Price (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours requesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled during selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request must be made prior to 1:30 p.m. C.T. of the third trading Day prior to the last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor ("Obligor"), are contemplating entering into an ENFOLIOÃ¢ Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date herewith and herein incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the "Gas Contract"), (ii) Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract (the "Obligations"); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas Contract (the "Indemnity Period").  With respect to any Claims threatened or filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE LIABILITY OF GUARANTOR HEREUNDER SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT, ACTUAL DAMAGES AND, UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE GAS CONTRACT, GUARANTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, OR ANY PENALTIES OR CHARGES ASSESSED BY ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED RECEIPT OF GAS.  Upon 30 Days written notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed $_____________ (the "Maximum Limit"); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.
