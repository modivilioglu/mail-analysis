That is great!  Let me know when you have time to talk this morning.  I can walk you through any questions regarding the LOI and the economic evaluation.

In addition, Dan and I still need to arrange a conference call with you regarding the Fort Union/Powder deal.  You and I should talk about it prior to that discussion just to make sure we are on the same page regarding the Ft Union capacity deal you are looking at.
