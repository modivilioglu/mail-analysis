Sorry to hear about your early departure.  Arrowhead is a very unique, beautiful course and we would love to have you come for as much golf as you can fit in.  Our earliest tee time is at 10:00 A.M. and I think you would need to be on the road at 11:30 at the latest.  So you might get in some time on the practice tee and a few holes before you have to leave.  The other option might be to delay your flight some if that is possible.
