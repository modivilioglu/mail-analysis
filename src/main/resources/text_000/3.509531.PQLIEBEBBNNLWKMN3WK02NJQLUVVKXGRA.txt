Russell, here is the proposed volume and price curve for AEC.  I will get back to you with the proper co. Name. when I confirm the entity. You should assume however that the sale comes from the parent. 

Let's work on the Master agreement, Credit covenants and pricing profile.  As discussed with Brant, the customer will look at fixed basis. in terms of pricing. 

Call me later. Thanks. BT
