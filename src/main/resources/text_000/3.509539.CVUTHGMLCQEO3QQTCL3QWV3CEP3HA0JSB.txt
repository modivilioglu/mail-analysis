Tiger Woods drives  his Volvo into a Petrol Station in Cork during his tour of Ireland. 
The  attendant at the pump greets him in a typical Irish manner, unaware as to who  the golf pro is, "Top o the morning to you young fella!" 
As Tiger leans  over to get out of the car two tees fall out of his top pocket onto the ground.  
"What are dey, son?" asks the attendant. 
"They're called tees"  replies Tiger Woods. 
"And what would dey be for then?" enquires the  Irish man. 
"They're for resting my balls on while I'm driving" says  Tiger Woods. 
"Oh, Jaysus", says the Irish man, "Dem boys at Volvo tink  of everyting!"
