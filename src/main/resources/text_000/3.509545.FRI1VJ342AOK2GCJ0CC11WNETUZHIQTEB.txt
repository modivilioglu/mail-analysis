When you talk to Robert Neustaedter, ask him about the Montebello storage field in Socal's territory that was blown down this year. I would like to know what application they filed, when it started and a summary of the details regarding this deal.

There was about 14 Bcf blown down.

For your reference in the 10:30 am (CST) meeting tomorrow, I have attached a memo outlining the potential WBI storage blowdown deal.  Please contact myself or Mark Whitt if you have any questions ahead of the meeting.
