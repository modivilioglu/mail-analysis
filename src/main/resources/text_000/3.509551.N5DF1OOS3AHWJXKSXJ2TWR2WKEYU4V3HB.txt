$1MM.  Could be another $45,000 because of interest rate decreases.

I have received the signed CMS Agreement.  I have signed it and returned it and we will be booking the earnings over the next couple of days.  Huber is trying to figure out how they will structure the purchases at the wellhead for royalty purposes.  They are doing this as part of their counterproposal to us.  I do not have very high expectations for this deal happening in the 3rd quarter.  However, Brian Stone will be stuck in a boat with just me and a guide for a total of 8 hours on Wed and Thurs. and I hope to make significant progress in that time.
