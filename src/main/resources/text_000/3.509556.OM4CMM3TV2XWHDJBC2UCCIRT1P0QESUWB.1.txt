A BILL FOR AN ACT

SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE DECLARATION.  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY DECLARES AND AFFIRMS THAT SANCTITY OF CONTRACT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.  WHEN EXPRESS CONTRACT TERMS ARE READ OUT OF EXISTENCE BY THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, A CLIMATE OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY IS CREATED TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE STATE’S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.  IN THE CASE OF WESTERMAN V. ROGERS, THE COLORADO SUPREME COURT SUBSTITUTED ITS OWN CONCEPTION, THE “IMPLIED DUTY TO MARKET”, FOR EXPRESS CONTRACT TERMS RELATING TO ROYALTY DETERMINATION FOR NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION.  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAS PREVIOUSLY ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION ADDRESSING THE PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF OIL AND GAS, INCLUDING A MECHANISM FOR PAYEES TO CHALLENGE DEDUCTIONS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SALES PRICE.  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HEREBY AMENDS THAT STATUTE TO SPECIFY THAT MAKING SUCH REQUEST FOR EXPLANATION IS A LEGAL PREREQUISITE TO THE FILING OF AN ACTION FOR JUDICIAL RELIEF AND THAT COURTS SHOULD GIVE EFFECT TO EXPRESS CONTRACT LANGUAGE REFLECTING THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES TO A LEASE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS.

SECTION 2.  SECTION 118.5 OF TITLE 34, ARTICLE 60, C.R.S., IS AMENDED BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW SUBSECTION TO READ:

(2)(C)  COURTS SHALL INTERPRET LEASES OR OTHER AGREEMENTS WHICH CONTAIN TERMS THAT RELATE TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF ANY PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS DERIVED FROM OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN A MANNER THAT GIVES MAXIMUM EFFECT TO THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRACTICES IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.  WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, A LEASE CALLS FOR THE PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS BASED ON THE VALUE OF PRODUCTION “AT THE WELL” AND, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF WELLHEAD PRODUCTION “IN-KIND”, COURTS SHOULD CONSTRUE SUCH CLAUSES SO AS TO ACHIEVE EQUIVALENT OUTCOMES.

SECTION 2. SECTION 118.5 OF TITLE 34, ARTICLE 60, C.R.S., IS AMENDED BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW SUBSECTION TO READ:

(2.6)  A PAYEE SHALL MAKE A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR EXPLANATION OF DEDUCTIONS OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS PRIOR TO FILING ANY CLAIM FOR DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF JURISDICTION.  FAILURE OF A PAYEE TO MAKE SUCH REQUEST, AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (2.5) OF THIS SECTION, MAY BE ASSERTED AS AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE BY A PAYOR WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH CLAIM.  FURTHER, ABSENT CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF FRAUDULENT CONDUCT ON THE PART OF A PAYOR, NO CLAIM MAY BE ASSERTED FOR RETROACTIVE DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENTS OF PROCEEDS MADE AND ACCEPTED PRIOR TO THE MAKING OF A REQUEST FOR EXPLANATION.
