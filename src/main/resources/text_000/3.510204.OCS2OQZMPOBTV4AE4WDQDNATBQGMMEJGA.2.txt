PRECEDENT AGREEMENT


This PRECEDENT AGREEMENT, dated as of this ____ day of ______________, 2001, is by and between Western Frontier Pipeline Company, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, hereinafter referred to as “WFP,” and __________________, hereinafter referred to as “Shipper.”  

 WHEREAS, Shipper desires to purchase firm transportation services to transport natural gas from the Rocky Mountain supply areas through WFP to access markets through direct customer connections and interconnections with other interstate pipelines including Williams Gas Pipeline Central’s (“WGPSC”) system; and

 WHEREAS, WFP desires to sell such transportation services to Shippers and other parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Precedent Agreement, of a related firm transportation agreement, and of its FERC Gas Tariff and applicable Rate Schedule to be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”); and

 WHEREAS, WFP’s ability to furnish the transportation services proposed is contingent upon WFP receiving the necessary regulatory authorizations to provide the services and to construct and operate the facilities, under terms and conditions satisfactory to WFP; and

 WHEREAS, prior to applying for certification from the FERC needed to begin the development and construction of the Western Frontier Pipeline Project, WFP requires firm and binding precedent agreements from parties that will transport gas through the Western Frontier Pipeline Project. Western Frontier Pipeline Project is designed to transport natural gas supplies from Wyoming and Colorado to markets in the mid-continent.  It is anticipated that the project will include the installation of approximately 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline and a new compressor station(s) with approximately 15,000 horsepower along the proposed project.  The new pipeline will start at the Cheyenne Hub and run southeast across Colorado through the southwest corner of Kansas and into the panhandle of Oklahoma; and

 WHEREAS, WFP and Shipper have agreed upon the firm transportation of natural gas as more fully described in this Precedent Agreement and in the transportation Service Request Form attached as “Appendix A”, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth therein and in this Precedent Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, Shipper is willing at this time to commit to purchase firm transportation services related to the Western Frontier Pipeline Project, upon its completion, on terms and conditions set forth in this Precedent Agreement, in a firm transportation agreement to be executed subsequently as provided below.  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and intending to be legally bound under this Precedent Agreement, WFP and Shipper agree as follows:  

FERC Filing and Acquisition of Other Rights.  

WFP shall use reasonable efforts to file by September 30, 2001, an application with FERC for authority to construct and operate the Western Frontier Pipeline Project.  
WFP shall proceed with reasonable diligence to obtain such other governmental and other regulatory authorizations, contract rights, and property rights as may be required for the construction and operation of the Western Frontier Pipeline Project and rendition of the transportation services contemplated herein, provided that WFP reserves the right to file and prosecute applications for such authorizations, any supplements or amendments thereto, and, if necessary, any court review, in such manner as to accomplish the objectives of this Precedent Agreement.  
Shipper agrees to support and cooperate actively with WFP to obtain all authorizations necessary for WFP to render the transportation services contemplated herein.  
Conditions Precedent.  Performance by WFP and Shipper of the duties and obligations assumed by each in this Precedent Agreement is expressly subject to the following conditions precedent:  
the issuance, in form and substance satisfactory to WFP, in its sole discretion, of all necessary certificates and other authorizations from FERC;
the issuance, in form and substance satisfactory to WFP, in its sole discretion, and acceptance of such other certificates, rates, rate schedules, exemptions, permits, or other authorizations as may be materially necessary for the performance of the transactions herein contemplated or for any other transactions necessary for the performance of those herein contemplated; and
the receipt of board of directors’ approval for this Precedent Agreement from both WFP and Shipper no later than September 30, 2001.
the subscription by Shipper and other shippers of the entire 540,000 Dth/D of firm capacity in the Western Frontier Pipeline Project at rates and terms acceptable to WFP.
Termination.  WFP shall have the right to terminate this Precedent Agreement by providing 60-days’ written notice to Shipper and to withdraw any applications for regulatory permits or approvals if WFP, in its sole discretion, determines that the Western Frontier Pipeline Project is or will become uneconomical.  
Services and Rates.  Within fifteen (15) days after fulfillment of the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 2, and as provided herein, WFP and Shipper will duly enter into firm transportation agreements having the following terms:
Term – As set forth in “Appendix A” attached hereto and made a part hereof.
Capacity - As set forth in “Appendix A” attached hereto and made a part hereof.
Receipt and Delivery Points – As set forth in “Appendix A” attached hereto and made a part hereof.
Reservation and Commodity Rates – The combined reservation and commodity rates state on a 100% Load Factor basis as set forth in “Appendix A” attached hereto and made a part hereof. The terms, conditions, and rates set forth in WFP’s FERC Gas Tariff and rate schedules, as such terms, conditions, and rates may change from time to time, shall govern the provision of firm transportation service contemplated herein.  In addition, Shipper shall also be responsible to pay WFP for all applicable Fuel charges, GRI Surcharges, ACA Surcharges, and any other FERC-approved charges and surcharges.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Precedent Agreement, in no event will the rate be more than the maximum rate nor shall the rate be less than the minimum rate, both as provided in WFP’s FERC Gas Tariff. 
Construction.
Upon (1) execution of sufficient precedent and firm transportation agreement(s) in the aggregate to justify economically the Western Frontier Pipeline Project, in the sole judgement of WFP; (2) the execution of the firm transportation agreement(s) as set forth in Paragraph 4 of this Precedent Agreement; (3) the performance of all conditions precedent as set forth in Paragraph 2, and (4) the satisfaction of any other conditions in WFP’s FERC Gas Tariff, WFP shall proceed with reasonable diligence with the construction of authorized facilities with the target date for the commencement of transportation services for Shipper on or about November 1, 2003.  
If, after proceeding with reasonable diligence to obtain necessary materials and to construct the necessary facilities, WFP is unable to complete such construction and place such facilities in operation by the aforementioned date, WFP shall continue to proceed with reasonable diligence to complete such construction, place such facilities in operation, and commence firm transportation services for Shipper at the earliest practicable date thereafter.  WFP shall not be liable, nor shall this Precedent Agreement or the firm transportation agreement be subject to cancellation, if, despite its exercise of reasonable diligence, WFP is unable to complete the construction of such facilities and commence the transportation services contemplated hereunder by November 1, 2003.  Shipper will not be liable for any payment due nor will any firm transportation agreement commence until construction of facilities to a proposed delivery point is complete and service is available. 
This Precedent Agreement is subject to any and valid laws, orders, rules, and regulations of governmental authorities having jurisdiction and to any and all other approvals.  This Agreement is further subject to modifications, including terminations, as FERC may require; provided, however, that the firm transportation agreement is not subject to any regulatory decision affecting payments due.  If any authority denies recovery or pass-through of Shipper’s obligations under the firm transportation agreement or rules adversely to Shipper, Shipper’s obligations to make all payments to WFP will nevertheless remain unaltered and in full force.  The firm transportation agreement is expressly subject to all tariff and rate filings made by WFP and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities and board of director’s approval.  
Amendment.  Any modification of or amendment to this Precedent Agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.  
Assignment.  Shipper shall not assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder unless it first shall have obtained the consent thereto in writing of WFP; such consent shall not be unreasonable withheld.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns to the parties.  
Recitals.  The recitals and representations appearing first above are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Precedent Agreement.  
Governing Law.  The interpretation and performance of this Precedent Agreement shall be in accordance with the laws of the state of Kentucky without regard to its conflicts of law principles.
FERC Gas Tariff.  This Agreement will be subject to WFP’s FERC Gas Tariff, as such tariff may change from time to time.

Except as herein otherwise provided, any notice, request, or demand provided for in this Precedent Agreement, or any notice that either Party may desire to give to the other, shall be in writing and shall be considered as duly delivered when mailed by registered or certified mail to the address below and when transmitted via facsimile if the Party providing notice confirms receipt of such facsimile via telephone.
