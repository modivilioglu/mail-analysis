 <<Enron Blew It - 11-01.doc>>  
I just opened my Texas Monthly, only to find more Enron news.

Did you see it?  The article entitled 
"HOW ENRON BLEW IT"
Enron's Cutthroat Culture (on the cover)
Texas Monthly, November 2001 By Mimi Swartz

For Houston's sake as the Energy Capital, we hope the best for Enron as it
turns this thing around.
Attached is the article and below is the link and an excerpt.  

If you have any comments on the article, we always like to hear them.

Best, Mark

INTRO EXCERPT
The Houston-based energy giant put the pursuit of profits ahead of all other
corporate goals, which fostered a climate of workaholism and paranoia.  And
that was only part of the problem.  (from the table of contents).

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything:
money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the
most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, Wall Street is
bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
