General Overview
The current economics related to transportation provide an excellent opportunity for PG&E customers to acquire physical transportation on EPNG at full tolls (or better) which provides:
Transportation at market based rates
Flexibility to manage price risk by purchasing gas at supply region versus market region
Avoid long term demand charges by avoiding having to enter into open seasons for 10-15 years when shorter dated capacity is available
Create optionality to the City of Santa Clara

Based on the City of Santa Clara’s current and future requirements (3,000 MMBtu/d increasing to 23,000 MMBtu/d), the capacity being discussed provides an excellent fit as:
the City of Santa Clara completes the construction of its 110 MW generation asset (start date Q2’03?)
Santa Clara can control its gas supply from wellhead to burner tip by integrating upstream transportation from the supply pools

This capacity is PG&E recallable (Block II) with primary receipt points of San Juan, Permian, and Anadarko, which will be re-designated to a 70% San Juan/30% Permian (est.) primary receipt point allocation (as per upcoming FERC orders)

x 24 hrs/day
22,440 MMBtu per day
Redwood Capacity of 6,800 MMBtu/d (expiration date?)
Proposed EPNG Capacity from ENA (20,000 MMBtu/d)
The ENA capacity is designed to fit Santa Clara’s supply shortfall beginning in 2003 as the 110 MW facility comes on

ENA Transportation Proposal
Benefits:
Definitive start date customized for customer needs
Short dated firm obligations:
ENA capacity expires May 31, 2006 and you hold the renewal rights.  The optionality of this expiration window could be significant.
Compared to open seasons that the industry just went through and the obligations recently committed to, this capacity is a premium transportation product.

ENA Transportation Proposal (cont’d)
Receipt point service will be diversified – 60-70% San Juan and 30-40% Permian

Regulatory uncertainty with El Paso is going to continue to prohibit any real expansions of the pipe until FERC issues regarding fuel requirements, CD shipper rights, and receipt point allocation are resolved (estimated to be February 2002).

ENA will pay either an up-front lump sum payment or an annuity payment, depending on customer preference (based on fair market value at the time of transaction).

Customer has option at the time of transfer to appoint ENA as agent to conduct operational and accounting services:
Nominations at receipt points
Pipeline nominations
Daily balancing
Consolidated statement – pipeline, payables, receivables

Historical Transportation Economics

For the period Jan 2000 through Sep 2001, this capacity would have been in the money 68% of the time and saved approximately $15-17 million (daily vs daily) on the 20,000 MMBtu/d

This capacity offers the buyer access to low cost and lower volatility supply with minimal downside risk
