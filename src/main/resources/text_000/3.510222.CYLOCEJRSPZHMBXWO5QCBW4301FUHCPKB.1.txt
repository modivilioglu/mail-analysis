Reducing the chance for deviation
Danger

Hedging Basics
Why?
Potential for unfavorable market movements
Volatility increases risk
Locked-in costs
We value less risk if we’re risk-averse
If not, you’re speculating


Why not?
Potential for favorable market movements
Commissions, fees and premiums
Knowledge and expertise lacking

Complex Financial Instruments:
Concepts and Case Studies

Load Serving
General Concept
Provides complete energy needs for a service area.
Can take many forms and include unique complexities depending upon the counterparty’s needs/risks.
Allows EM&T to optimize its portfolio and realize value from asset optimization while providing a growth platform.
Counterparty receives mitigated commodity risk and tools for growth.
How it works:
Counterparty has certain amount of load (demand) that can be serviced by existing generation.
Shortage must be obtained on open market as demand and volatility increases.
Counterparty lacks risk management tools/expertise and partners with EM&T.
EM&T meets shortage obligation via financial instruments, portfolio length and/or new generation.

Almost completed deal with major NE player…would have saved them $165 MM last year if legislation would’ve allowed the deal to go through…that value is out there to be captured and shared...

In short, you identify your risks, we identify our risks, and between us, no value is left on the table and we both have a fair and equitable exchange...
